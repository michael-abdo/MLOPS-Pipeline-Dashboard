## Frontend Event Listeners

Based on the analysis, the frontend is listening for all the events that the backend is broadcasting. The WebSocket manager in `websocket.js` uses a generic event emitter pattern that forwards all events with a `type` field to specific listeners.

## Event Categories and Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented Events (23 total)
1. **Pipeline Management** (4): pipeline_progress, pipeline_completed, pipeline_failed, pipeline_status
2. **Monitoring** (4): service_health, performance_metrics, system_alert, chart_data
3. **Data Management** (5): upload_progress, dataset_processed, quality_assessment, job_progress, job_completed
4. **Architecture** (2): component_health, integration_status
5. **Training** (3): training_progress, training_completed, training_failed
6. **System** (5): activity_update, system_metrics, model_deployed, health_change, prediction_volume

### Event Flow
1. Backend broadcasts events using `manager.broadcast_json()` or helper functions
2. Events include a `type` field that identifies the event
3. Frontend WebSocket manager receives and parses JSON messages
4. Events are emitted to both generic 'message' listeners and specific type listeners
5. Page-specific handlers process events based on their type

### Key Observations
1. **All expected events are implemented** - The backend provides comprehensive WebSocket event coverage
2. **Real-time updates work across all features** - Pipeline execution, training, monitoring, and data processing all have proper event broadcasting
3. **System health monitoring is robust** - Multiple layers of health checking and alerting
4. **Event payloads are well-structured** - Each event includes relevant data for the frontend to update UI

### WebSocket Connection Features
- **Heartbeat/Ping-Pong**: Implemented for connection quality monitoring
- **Auto-reconnect**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Connection quality tracking**: Based on latency measurements
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues to function if WebSocket disconnects

## Conclusion
The WebSocket implementation is comprehensive and properly handles all the events needed for real-time updates across the MLOps dashboard. All frontend expectations are met by the backend implementation.
