# Frontend-Backend Integration Analysis Summary

## Overview
This analysis reveals significant gaps between the frontend implementation (completed in Phase 1-4) and the backend support. While the Dashboard page has full backend integration, the Pipeline, Data, Monitoring, and Architecture pages are frontend-only shells without backend support.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Route Implementation Status**
- ✅ Dashboard (`/`) - Fully functional
- ✅ Settings (`/settings`) - Fully functional  
- ❌ Pipeline (`/pipeline`) - Returns 404
- ❌ Architecture (`/architecture`) - Returns 404
- ❌ Data (`/data`) - Returns 404
- ❌ Monitoring (`/monitoring`) - Returns 404

### 2. **Missing Core Systems**
- No authentication/authorization system
- No pipeline execution engine
- No dataset management system
- No component health monitoring
- No advanced model operations

### 3. **WebSocket Event Gaps**
- Frontend expects 15+ event types
- Backend only sends 9 event types
- Missing events for pipeline, monitoring, data, and architecture features

### 4. **Data Structure Mismatches**
- Frontend expects richer data formats
- Backend provides minimal fields
- Mock data used extensively in new pages

- **Priority Implementation Plan**: `backend_improvement_priority_plan.txt`
- **This Summary**: `summary.md`

## Recommendation
Implement backend improvements in 5 phases over 5 weeks, starting with critical foundation (authentication, API standardization) and progressing through core features to advanced capabilities.
